            Responsive design is a term used to describe the way a website is coded to provide the optimal viewing, reading and navigation experience with minimal resizing, animation and navigation across a wide range of devices, from desktop monitors to telephones. Mobile

             
            Responsive design is achieved through a combination of flexible grids and layouts, images and clever use of CSS media queries. As the user switches from their laptop to the iPad, the website should automatically change to match the resolution, image size and script capabilities. In other words, the website must have the technology to automatically respond to the user's preferences. This eliminates the need for a different design and development phase for each new gadget on the market.

            
            I learned that responsive design is important to ensure that your website is easily visible on any type of device. I also learned that it is important to use media queries to ensure that your website looks good on different screen sizes. Overall, I enjoyed doing research on this topic and learned a lot about responsive design.

        Lectures and Assignments were fun and valuable to do. I never had experience about web and JavaScript coding before. I found JavaScript much more useful than other programming course I had but still I’m not sure which one will be more useful in market.(I felt we’re getting some real output from running our codes in chrome or Microsoft edge)
        This course caused I learn many new things and gain experience. I’m pretty sure we’ll have some complicated tasks in next semester that this course was a great start.
